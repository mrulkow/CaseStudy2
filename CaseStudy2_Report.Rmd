## Instructions

In the bottom right window, click on the file titled `CaseStudy2_Instructions.pdf`. Thoroughly read through the background and assignment instructions in order to complete the case study below. We encourage you to work on this assignment with a partner, but only active lab approach students may submit their work in pairs.

**Note:** only *active* lab approach students may submit case study assignments with a partner. Your partner must be in the same lab section - and you both must be in attendance during the corresponding lab session. Failure to adhere to these rules will result in a penalty applied to your case study score. *Students that correctly submit as a team will receive 5 points of extra credit towards their final case study score.*

## Goal

Some of the research linked in the instruction file suggests that strength and agility are inversely related among NFL athletes. Your task is to analyze the available data and decide whether it supports or contradicts this claim. Namely, we wish to analyze how an athleteâ€™s strength (measured by vj) relates to their agility (measured by sp) by exploring the following research questions:

1. What association, if any, exists between athlete strength and agility, as measured by vj and sp?
2. What association, if any, exists between athlete strength and endurance, as measured by vj and bp?
3. What association, if any, exists between athlete endurance and agility, as measured by bp and sp?
4. Does athlete endurance (as measured by bp) influence the association between strength (vj) and agility (sp)?

## Data

The `combine` data set contains variables recorded from a random sample of n = 200 prospective NFL athletes who participated in the NFL Combine between 1999 and 2016. The variables include:

- `bp.endurance`: An indicator of whether the athlete fell above or below the combine average number of completed reps before failure (Above Average Endurance or Below Average Endurance)
- `vj.strength`: An indicator of whether the athlete fell above or below the combine average vertical jump cleared (Above Average Strength or Below Average Strength)
- `sp.agility`: A variable recording the completion time of the 3 cone drill (measured in seconds)


Use the following code chunks to read in and preview the data set. 

```{r read_data}
load("combine.rda")
```

```{r preview_data}
head(combine)
```

And be sure to load in any necessary packages!

```{r load_packages}
library(ggplot2)
```

7. Head to Gradescope and navigate to the corresponding assignment. 

8. Click "Submit PDF" and upload your saved `CaseStudy2_Report.pdf` file. 

9. Assign the pages of your document to the corresponding questions in Gradescope. Be sure that each question has *all* of the corresponding pages attached (i.e., Analysis for Research Question 1 may be pages 3 *and* 4 of your document. )

10. Click "Submit". Confirm that the pages of your document match the corresponding questions in Gradescope.

11. *If you are submitting with a partner*, click on "Group Members" at the bottom of the webpage. Search for your partner's name and click "Add".


**Note:** only *active* lab approach students may submit lab assignments with a partner. Your partner must be in the same lab section - and you both must be in attendance during the corresponding lab session. Failure to adhere to these rules will result in a penalty applied to your lab score. Students that correctly submit as a team will receive 5 points of extra credit towards their final case study score.

**Note:** you can resubmit as many times as needed until the posted deadline.
